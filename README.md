UPDATE: The project has been moved to here: https://github.com/Chaosminecraft/Text-converter

# Custom-Encoder
The Project just started out of fun and is an hobby and i kinda learn with that Project at once,
so please note if an AV says that the File is something bad, it is maybe that the file isn't that known,
i make it open source that everyone can have a Look and then Mail me too if they have any suggestions or how to add things better.
the Project will as long i work on it (Chaosminecraft) be for free and OPen source. if you made a Change or added something, feel free to add a Credit to you.
